# 5.0 Study Area

A [**study area**](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#study_area) is a unique research, inventory or monitoring area (spatial boundary) within a [project](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#project). There may be multiple [study areas](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#study_area) within a single [project](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#project). Several factors may influence the spatial extent of the [study area](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#study_area), including the [Survey Objectives](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#survey_objectives), landscape features (e.g., habitat type, land uses, etc.), the biology of the [Target Species](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#target_species)' (e.g., dispersal ability, habitat preferences, etc.) and proposed method(s) of data analysis.
