    "When designing a remote camera [project](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#project) (e.g., scientific study, [inventory](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#mods_inventory), or monitoring program), it is helpful to think of the hierarchy of information collected throughout the study. Doing so will:\n",

Metadata Standards](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/environment/natural-resource-stewardship/nr-laws-policy/risc/wcmp_v1.pdf) (RISC, 2019), thus promoting standardized data collection and information sharing;\n",

    "The [AB Metadata Standards](https://ab-rcsc.github.io/RCSC-WildCAM_Remote-Camera-Survey-Guidelines-and-Metadata-Standards/2_metadata-standards/2_0.1_Citation-and-Info.html) (RCSC, 2024) propose that data should be collected at six broad levels ([project](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#project), [study area](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#study_area), [survey](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#survey), [sample station](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#sample_station) / [camera location](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#camera_location), [deployment](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#deployment), and image/[sequence](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#sequence)). This hierarchy was adapted from Forrester et al. (2016) and the [B.C. Metadata Standards](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/environment/natural-resource-stewardship/nr-laws-policy/risc/wcmp_v1.pdf) (RISC, 2019) by adding one more level ([sample station](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#sample_station) / [camera location](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#camera_location)):\n",

    "-   **Project** – a scientific study, [inventory](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#mods_inventory) or monitoring program that has a certain [objective](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#survey_objectives), defined methods, and a defined boundary in space and time (recorded as “[Project Name](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#project_name)“).\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Study area** – a unique research, [inventory](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#mods_inventory) or monitoring area(s) (spatial boundary) within a [project](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#project) (there may be multiple [study areas](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#study_area) within a single [project](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#project)) (recorded as “[Study Area Name](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#study_area_name)“).\n",

There may be multiple deployments for one [camera location](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#camera_location). Deployments are often considered as the time between visits (i.e., deployment to service, service to service, and service to retrieval). Any change to [camera location](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#camera_location), sampling period, camera equipment (e.g., [Trigger Sensitivity](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#settings_trigger_sensitivity) setting, becomes non-functioning), and/or conditions (e.g., not baited then baited later; camera SD card replaced) should be documented as a unique [deployment](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#deployment).\n",
