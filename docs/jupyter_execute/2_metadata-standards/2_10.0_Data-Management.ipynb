    "Data management is a critical component of any [project](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#project). Below are recommendations on file naming conventions and file structure to help manage remote camera data. Refer to the [Remote Camera Survey Guidelines](https://ab-rcsc.github.io/RCSC-WildCAM_Remote-Camera-Survey-Guidelines-and-Metadata-Standards/1_survey-guidelines/1_0.1_Citation-and-Info.html) (RCSC et al., 2024) for additional information topics related to data management, including software platforms and tools to help camera users enter [metadata](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#metadata) as well as store, process and analyze image data.\n",

    "## 10.1 Naming conventions\n",
    "\n",
    "It is highly recommended that users develop a set of naming conventions prior to entering data. Using naming conventions will minimize the risk of having images from different [deployments](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#deployment), [study areas](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#study_area), or [surveys](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#survey) with the same name. Note that many [metadata](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#metadata)/data repositories (e.g., [B.C. Metadata Standards](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/environment/natural-resource-stewardship/nr-laws-policy/risc/wcmp_v1.pdf) [RISC, 2019], [Wildlife Insights Minimum Metadata Standards](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Jg-WybmVeGlWGrbPpwuwJCgranOV1r3M_LrzELttfK0/edit#gid=412365965) [Ahumada et al., 2019], [WildTrax](https://portal.wildtrax.ca)) have required field formats and special character limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Naming conventions are especially important for the following fields:\n",

    "-   [Project Name](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#project_name)\n",

    "-   [Study Area Name](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#study_area_name)\n",

    "### 10.1.2 Renaming images\n",
    "\n",
    "If you wish to rename your images, it is highly recommended that renamed images reflect the associated [Image Name](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#image_name).\n",
    "\n",
    "Data entry software can be used for batch processing of image names, which can significantly reduce data processing time compared to renaming images manually (e.g., [Timelapse2](http://saul.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/timelapse/) [Greenberg, 2018], [Reconyx MapView](http://www.reconyx.com/software/mapview;) [Reconyx, Holmen, WI, USA]) or other tools (e.g., [WildCo Lab's Image Renamer](https://github.com/WildCoLab/WildCo_Image_Renamer) [WildCo Lab, 2021b]). Note that it is not always necessary to rename images. For example, renaming would not be required if data are stored in a folder structure that identifies the [camera location](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#camera_location) and the [survey](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#survey) from which it was collected.\n",
    "\n",
    "(#TOC_md_standards_file_structure)=\n",
    "\n",
    "## 10.2 File structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Image data ideally should be stored in a hierarchical structure as shown in ([Figure 1](/2_metadata-standards/2_3.0_Metadata-Standards.md#TOC_md_standards_fig_1)). Each level would typically comprise a series of file subfolders containing data from the level below it (e.g., a [project](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#project) folder with study area subfolders, with each [study area](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#study_area) with [survey](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#survey) subfolders etc.). For example, [Figure 2](#TOC_md_standards_fig_2) shows the file structure for a [project](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#project) that consisted of two [study areas](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#study_area), each with one [survey](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#survey) and each [survey](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#survey) with two [camera locations](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#camera_location) with one [deployment](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#deployment) period and two sequences per [camera location](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#camera_location).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this is often not the way we store this information in the form of CSVs (e.g., if there are only one or two [study areas](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#study_area), it might not make sense to store this information in a separate CSV file). These [metadata](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#metadata) standards suggest a CSV structure similar to that of other [metadata](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#metadata)/data repositories (e.g., [B.C. Metadata Standards](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/environment/natural-resource-stewardship/nr-laws-policy/risc/wcmp_v1.pdf) [RISC, 2019], [Wildlife Insights Minimum Metadata Standards](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Jg-WybmVeGlWGrbPpwuwJCgranOV1r3M_LrzELttfK0/edit#gid=412365965) [Ahumada et al., 2019], [WildTrax](https://portal.wildtrax.ca)) that consists of four CSVs associated with these [metadata](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#metadata) standards:\n",

    "-   Deployment CSV\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Image/Sequence CSV (includes Event Type = \"Tag\")\n",
    "\n",
    "The information from each CSV can be linked using identifiers for each of the levels in the folder structure/hierarchy (refer to [Figure 3](#TOC_md_standards_fig_3)) so that redundant information does not need to be repeated, and the chance of error is reduced. The connections between the levels and CSVs are also outlined in [Appendix A - Table A2](/2_metadata-standards/2_13.0_AppendixA.md#TOC_md_standards_table_a2).\n",
