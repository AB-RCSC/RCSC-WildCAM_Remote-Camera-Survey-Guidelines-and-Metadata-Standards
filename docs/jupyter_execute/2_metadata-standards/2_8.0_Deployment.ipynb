    "A [deployment](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#deployment) is a unique placement of a camera in space and time (recorded as \"Deployment Name\"). There may be multiple [deployments](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#deployment) for one [camera location](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#camera_location). [Deployments](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#deployment) are often considered as the time between [visits](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#visit) to a [camera location](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#camera_location) (i.e., [deployment](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#deployment) to service, service to service, and service to retrieval). Any change to [camera location](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#camera_location), sampling period, camera equipment (e.g., [Trigger Sensitivity setting](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#settings_trigger_sensitivity), becomes non-functioning), and/or conditions (e.g., not [baited](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#baitlure_bait) then not [baited](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#baitlure_bait) later; camera SD card replaced) should be documented as a unique [deployment](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#deployment).\n",

    "If a camera fails (stops functioning), the [Deployment End Date Time](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#deployment_end_date_time) should be the date the camera was last known to be operational.

This will allow users to more accurately determine failure dates. For example, it may be difficult to determine a failure date for a camera that is only occasionally [triggered](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#trigger_event) by animals (e.g., on a weekly basis). Taking an image at a prescribed interval also provides a consistent record of site conditions over time (e.g., snow cover, vegetation growth).\n",

For example, if the camera was set to take three images per event at a [Motion Image Interval](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#settings_motion_image_interval) of three seconds when the camera detects motion or heat, the first image will be collected (e.g., at 09:00:00), the second image will be collected three seconds later (09:00:03), and the third will be collected three seconds after that (09:00:06).
