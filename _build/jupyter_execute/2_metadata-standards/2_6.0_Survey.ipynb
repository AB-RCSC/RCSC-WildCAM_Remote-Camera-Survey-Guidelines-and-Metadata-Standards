Conversely, multiple [tags](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#tag) are applied when individuals in an image differ in their characteristics (e.g., an [Adult](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#age_class_adult) and a [Juvenile](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#age_class_juvenile), all else remaining equal, are tagged separately).
