    "A [**project**](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#project) is a scientific study, inventory or monitoring program that has a certain objective, defined methods, and a defined boundary in space and time. Careful consideration of the objectives and survey design for any remote camera [project](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#project) is encouraged. Recommendations on the appropriate survey designs to achieve various objectives are available in the [Remote Camera Survey Guidelines](https://ab-rcsc.github.io/RCSC-WildCAM_Remote-Camera-Survey-Guidelines-and-Metadata-Standards/1_survey-guidelines/1_0.1_Citation-and-Info.html) (RCSC et al., 2024).\n",
