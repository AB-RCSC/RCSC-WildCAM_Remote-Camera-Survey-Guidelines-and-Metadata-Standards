    "The camera \"make\" is the manufacturer of a particular camera (e.g., Reconyx), and the \"model\" is the model number of a particular camera (e.g., PC900). There are many different options and features to choose from when deciding upon the best [Camera Make](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#camera_make) and [Camera Model](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#camera_model) for a particular study, which differ in their impacts on [detection probability](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#detection_probability).

When choosing a [Camera Make](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#camera_make) and [Camera Model](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#camera_model), important specifications include [trigger speed](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#trigger_speed), [recovery time](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#recovery_time), [detection zone](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#detection_zone) (i.e., the area [conical in shape] in which a remote camera can detect the heat signature and motion of an object Rovero & Zimmermann, 2016; see [Figure 5](#TOC_surv_guidelines_fig_5)), battery life and flash type. The best choice of [Camera Model](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#camera_model) will depend on the [Survey Objectives](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#survey_objectives), [modelling approach](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#mods_modelling_approach), [Target Species](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#target_species), and physical environment.\n",

    "\n",
    "Most remote cameras require AA batteries. It is recommended to use **lithium batteries,** as opposed to alkaline or nickel metal hydride, because they are less affected by cold temperatures. Battery life will be affected not only by the type of batteries but also by the camera settings, temperature, and number of images or videos taken (which are dependent on the camera settings, placement, and level of activity in front of the camera) (Wearn & Glover-Kapfer, 2017). However, some camera user manuals contain information on battery performance and the total number of images a camera can be expected to collect before the batteries die (based on the operating temperature and battery type, e.g., [Reconyx HyperFire Instruction Manual](https://images.reconyx.com/file/HyperFireManual.pdf) [Reconyx Inc., 2017]).\n",

    "### 7.1.2 SD cards\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to consider the **size**, **type**, and **class** of **SD (Secure Digital) card** since the available options vary in storage capacity, compatibility, and write-speed (Wearn & Glover-Kapfer, 2017).\n",
    "\n",
    "The **size of the SD card** (i.e., storage capacity) should be considered in relation to the expected duration of [deployment](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#deployment), the deployment area, and the level of activity expected to occur in front of the camera. For example, a camera placed in a grassy area might be expected to produce more [false triggers](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#false_trigger) due to grass waving in front of the camera. Or perhaps a camera placed near a den might be expected to have higher animal activity. Both situations might warrant using a larger SD card. A 4 GB SD card is capable of storing \\~8,000-20,000 images (400-900 KB in size), which might be sufficient if you plan to revisit the camera frequently (\\~every four weeks) (Wearn & Glover-Kapfer, 2017). We suggest using a card with at least 16 GB, and Wearn & Glover-Kapfer (2017) suggest larger (32 GB) if the video is enabled or if the camera will be active for long periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three **types of SD card:** standard (SD; maximum memory of 2 GB), high-capacity (SDHC; maximum memory of 32 GB) and extended-capacity (SDXC; maximum memory of \\> 32 GB) (Wearn & Glover-Kapfer, 2017). Note that SDHC cards are not compatible with most [Camera Models](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#camera_model). Be sure to check the camera user manual to confirm the compatible SD card type(s) (Wearn & Glover-Kapfer, 2017).\n",
    "\n",
    "The **“class” of an SD card** (e.g., class 2, 4, 6, or 10) indicates the “write-speed” (i.e., the speed at which the SD card can read and write data; Wearn & Glover-Kapfer, 2017). Slower write speeds may perform poorly if the camera is set to collect images continuously, as fast as possible (i.e., rapid-fire or “near-video”) or if the video setting is activated. It is recommended to use an SD card of class 4 or higher, ideally class 10 (Wearn & Glover-Kapfer, 2017).\n",
    "\n",
    "Caution should be used when deploying older SD cards (Wearn & Glover-Kapfer, 2017) and, perhaps, microSD card types; a few remote camera users in Alberta have described a 50% SD card failure rate with microSD cards (St. Clair, personal communications). See Wearn & Glover-Kapfer (2017) for additional information on choosing and maintaining (i.e., regularly formatting) SD cards.\n",

    "\n",
    "As mentioned above, in [camera hardware options](/1_survey-guidelines/1_7.0_Camera-deployment.md#TOC_surv_guidelines_camera_hardware_options), it is important to distinguish between camera specifications (features) versus settings (user-defined options). Important settings often include [Trigger Sensitivity](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#settings_trigger_sensitivity) (which may affect [detection probability](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#detection_probability)), [Motion Image Interval](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#settings_motion_image_interval) and [Quiet Period](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#settings_quiet_period). The setting option selected may vary according to the [Survey Objectives](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#survey_objectives), [modelling approach](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#mods_modelling_approach), [Target Species](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#target_species), and use (or not) of attractants. Consideration of the camera settings is an important step when designing a [survey](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#survey) and in the interpretation of the resulting images.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of the settings available in a Reconyx camera is included in [Appendix A - Table A3](/1_survey-guidelines/1_10.1_AppendixA-Tables.md#TOC_surv_guidelines_table_aurv_guidelines_photos-vs-video).\n",

    "\n",
    "Some [Camera Models](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#camera_model) allow the user to record video as well as photos. Videos typically use more memory on SD cards, drain camera batteries sooner and are more difficult to process (i.e., extract data) than images. Limiting the length of video taken when the camera is [triggered](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#trigger_event) (possible for most [Camera Models](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#camera_model)) could help slow how quickly an SD card becomes full. Some [Camera Models](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#camera_model) have hybrid settings, which lets you capture photos and videos for each animal detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is generally recommended that cameras are set to capture images rather than videos unless the [objective](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#survey_objectives) is related to monitoring animal behaviours, understanding group size and/or determining recruitment (e.g. calves per female), in which case continuous observation may be important. Video is also useful when individual identification is needed, such as for creating “marked” individuals for use in machine learning or computer vision (e.g., Schneider et al., 2019; Vidal et al., 2021).\n",

    "[Time-lapse images](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#timelapse_image) are images taken at regular intervals (e.g., hourly or daily, on the hour), regardless of whether an animal is present or not. It is critical to take a minimum of one [time-lapse image](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#timelapse_image) per day at a consistent time (e.g., 12:00 p.m. [noon]) to create a record of camera functionality or local environmental conditions (e.g., snow cover, plant growth, wildfire; Sun et al., 2021)\n",

    "\n",
    "The [**Trigger Sensitivity**](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#settings_trigger_sensitivity) is camera setting responsible for how sensitive a camera is to activation (to \"[triggering](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#trigger_event)\") via the infrared and/or heat detectors (if applicable, e.g., Reconyx HyperFire cameras have a choice between \"Low,\" \"Low/Med,\" \"Med,\" \"Med/High,\" \"High,\" \"Very high\" and \"Unknown\"). That is, how the camera is activated once the animal enters the [detection zone](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#detection_zone). A high [Trigger Sensitivity](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#settings_trigger_sensitivity) is ideal when estimating [density](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#density) or abundance using mark-recapture or [occupancy modelling](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#mods_occupancy) (Rovero et al., 2013). The more easily (and faster) the camera is [triggered](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#trigger_event), the more likely it is to photograph approaching animals as they enter the area (Apps & McNutt, 2018). High [Trigger Sensitivity](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#settings_trigger_sensitivity) (and fast [Motion Image Intervals](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#settings_motion_image_interval)) are less necessary if attractants are present (Rovero et al., 2013). Refer to [section 6.2](/1_survey-guidelines/1_6.0_Study-design.md#TOC_surv_guidelines_site_selection_and_camera_arrangement) for examples of ideal [Trigger Sensitivity](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#settings_trigger_sensitivity) settings to achieve certain [Survey Objectives](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#survey_objectives).\n",

    "The camera user can also predefine the number of photos taken each time the camera is [triggered](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#trigger_event) (i.e., “[Photos Per Trigger](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#settings_photos_per_trigger), e.g., 1, 2, 3, 5 or 10 photos). The user can specify the time interval between images (i.e., the “[Motion Image Interval](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#settings_motion_image_interval)“) or the time interval between image [sequences](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#sequence) (i.e., the “[**Quiet Period**](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#settings_quiet_period)“ or “time lag,” depending on the [Camera Make](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#camera_make) and [Camera Model](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#camera_model)). The [Quiet Period](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#settings_quiet_period) differs from the [Motion Image Interval](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#settings_motion_image_interval) in that the delay occurs between multi-image [sequences](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#sequence) rather than between the images contained within multi-image [sequences](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#sequence) (as in [Motion Image Interval](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#settings_motion_image_interval)). Setting the camera to take continuous photos (i.e., the [Quiet Period](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#settings_quiet_period) set to “no delay”) will fill the SD card with more photos per detection; however, it may provide important information for identifying individual animals, determining enter-leave times and regarding animal behaviours / interactions.\n",

    "There are many options of [bait](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#baitlure_bait) and [lure](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#baitlure_lure) available, and those used in camera studies have included commercial [scent lures](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#baitlure_scent_lure), food [bait](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#baitlure_bait)s, carcasses and compact disks (see Wearn & Glover-Kapfer, 2017 for details and examples). [Scent lure](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#baitlure_scent_lure) is typically applied to objects in the [detection zone](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#detection_zone) (e.g., trees or rocks), whereas a food [lure](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#baitlure_lure) is generally hung up or placed behind wire mesh to limit tampering by animals. Food rewards ([baits](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#baitlure_bait) or carcasses) are also used but are more likely to influence behaviour and inter- and intra-specific interactions (e.g., avoidance of an area or conflict between individuals or species) and may result in food conditioning, which in turn may lead to human-wildlife conflict.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some options are costly and require frequent reapplication during the [survey](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#survey) [deployment](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#deployment).

[Scent lure](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#baitlure_scent_lure) dispensers, such as those developed by the Woodland Park Zoo, may help reduce the number of visits needed for reapplication and associated costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Few studies have compared the efficacy of different types of attractants, but both Espartosa et al. (2011) and Thorn et al. (2009) suggested that food [baits](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#baitlure_bait) are more effective than [scent lures](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#baitlure_scent_lure) for many species (although these evaluations did not include wildlife species from Canada).\n",

    "Since species may respond to [lure](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#baitlure_lure) types and scents differently, the type of [lure](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#baitlure_lure) chosen (if any) should be based on the biology of the [Target Species](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#target_species) but also on the [Survey Objectives](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#survey_objectives) and the [survey](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#survey) environment. For example, liquid products may be less suitable in areas where precipitation is high. Some [lure](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#baitlure_lure) types smell like the urine of a particular species, which could result in higher detections of certain species by activating an investigative response while resulting in avoidance by other species. Interestingly, a [study](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.30.926618v1.abstract) (Holinda et al., 2020) by members of WildCAM found no evidence that [scent lure](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#baitlure_scent_lure) placed at camera stations repelled non-target (i.e., prey) animals (see also Mills et al., 2019); rather, both predators and prey showed varied responses to the [scent lure](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#baitlure_scent_lure).\n",

To reduce potential biases, cameras should ideally be deployed using a [paired design](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#sampledesign_paired), with cameras on- and off-[FOV Target Features](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#fov_target) (e.g., on- and off-trails).\n",

Cameras should be positioned and secured to an attachment point at **\\~0.5–1 m height** (from the ground to the bottom of the lens; Meek et al., 2014). The most appropriate [Camera Height](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#camera_height) will be influenced by the terrain (e.g., slope), the angle of the tree, as well as the [Target Species](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#target_species). Cameras placed closer to the ground reduce the probability that large animals (e.g., moose) will be fully in the frame in the photos. Similarly, if the camera is placed too high, only larger animals will activate the motion detector, and smaller species may be missed (e.g., hares, squirrels, marten) (Meek et al., 2016). The user should ensure that the [Camera Height](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#camera_height) adequately detects motion at a specified [Walktest Distance (m)](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#walktest_distance) and [Walktest Height (m)](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#walktest_height).

    "The direction a camera faces is an important consideration because it affects the amount of light that reaches the area, which has implications for both [detection probability](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#detection_probability) and image quality (reduced quality via sun glare). Ideally, cameras should face north (N, i.e. “0” degrees), or south (S; i.e. “180” degrees) if north is not possible. Sun glare is the most problematic for cameras that face east or west by causing [false triggers](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#false_trigger) unless there is thick tree cover blocking the sun (standing water may also produce similar problems with sun glare).\n",

    "The camera direction should be chosen to ensure the field of view (FOV) is of the original FOV target feature. Generally, cameras should be placed **perpendicular to the expected direction of animal travel** (e.g., along a game or human trail). Since there is a delay between when an animal enters the camera’s [detection zone](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#detection_zone) and when it captures an image, placing the camera perpendicular to the trail increases the likelihood that an animal will be in the frame when the camera [triggers](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#trigger_event) (Apps & McNutt, 2018).

A large margin of error in collecting coordinates may result in the misclassification of land cover (Robinson et al., 2020) or increase the difficulty of another field [crew](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#crew) finding a camera. It is important to record the accuracy (margin of error) of the GPS unit used to record spatial information (coordinates) (i.e., the [GPS unit accuracy](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#gps_unit_accuracy), e.g., Garmin GPS devices are accurate to within +/- 15 metres 95% of the time). [GPS unit accuracy](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#gps_unit_accuracy) may vary by the make and model of the GPS unit (Hall et al., 2008), but it also may be affected by nearby vegetation, infrastructure, atmospheric interference, etc. (Ganskopp & Johnson, 2007).\n",
