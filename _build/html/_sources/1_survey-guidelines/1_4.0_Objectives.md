# 4.0 Objectives

An essential first step when designing any [survey](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#survey) is to clearly define its [objectives](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#survey_objectives). [Survey Objectives](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#survey_objectives) should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and time-bound (i.e., SMART). [Survey Objectives](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#survey_objectives) should describe the following:

-   [Target Species](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#target_species) - the species that the [survey](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#survey) is designed to detect,

-   [State variable(s)](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#state_variable) - a formal measure that summarizes the state of a community or population at a particular time (Wearn & Glover-Kapfer, 2017) (e.g., species richness or population abundance), and

-   Proposed [modelling approach(es)](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#mods_modelling_approach) - the method used to analyze the camera data, which should depend on the [state variable](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#state_variable) (e.g., [occupancy models](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#mods_occupancy) [MacKenzie et al., 2002], [spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR) models](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#mods_scr_secr) [e.g., Royle et al., 2009] for [density](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#density) estimation, etc.) and the [Target Species](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#target_species). To learn more about the different [modelling approaches](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#mods_modelling_approach), refer to [Appendix A - Table A1](/1_survey-guidelines/1_10.1_AppendixA-Tables.md#TOC_surv_guidelines_table_a1), [Appendix A - Table A2](/1_survey-guidelines/1_10.1_AppendixA-Tables.md#TOC_surv_guidelines_table_a2), and [WildCAM’s resource library](https://wildcams.ca/library/camera-trapping-papers-directory/).

An example of a clearly defined [Survey Objective](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#survey_objectives) could be “to monitor trends in wolverine [occupancy](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#occupancy) at 5-year intervals from March – December 2020 to 2030 in wildlife management unit 539”.

The [Survey Objective](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#survey_objectives) will determine the appropriate [study design](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#survey) and [deployment](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#deployment) considerations (e.g., [camera spacing](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#camera_spacing), [survey](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#survey) effort, attractants or not). For example, based on the above objective for our wolverine [occupancy](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#occupancy) [project](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#project), we “randomly selected [camera locations](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#camera_location) within a 15 km x 15 km grid cell with one camera per location and a total of 60 stations across our [study area](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#study_area). We will place [lure](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#baitlure_lure) dispensers at each [camera location](/3_glossary/3_Glossary.md#camera_location) to increase the likelihood of detecting a wolverine.” to increase the likelihood of detecting a wolverine.”
